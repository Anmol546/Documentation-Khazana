HashiCorp Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool that allows DevOps engineers to programmatically provision the physical resources an application requires to run.

Infrastructure as code is an IT practice that manages an application's underlying IT infrastructure through programming. This approach to resource allocation allows developers to logically manage, monitor and provision resources -- as opposed to requiring that an operations team manually configure each required resource.

Terraform users define and enforce infrastructure configurations by using a JSON-like configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). HCL's simple syntax makes it easy for DevOps teams to provision and re-provision infrastructure across multiple cloud and on-premises data centers.

What is Terraform used for?
External resource management -- Terraform supports public and private cloud infrastructure, as well as network appliances and software as a service (SaaS) deployments.
Multi-cloud deployment -- the software tool's native ability to support multiple cloud services helps increase fault tolerance.
Multi-tier applications -- Terraform allows each resource collection to easily be scaled up or down as needed.
Self-service clusters -- the registries make it easy for users to find prepackaged configurations that can be used as is or modified to meet a particular need.
Software defined networking (SDN) -- Terraform's readability makes it easy for network engineers to codify the configuration for an SDN.
Resource scheduler -- Terraform modules can stop and start resources on AWS and allow Kubernetes to schedule Docker containers.
Disposable environments -- modules can be used to create an ad hoc, throwaway test environment for code before it's put into production.
